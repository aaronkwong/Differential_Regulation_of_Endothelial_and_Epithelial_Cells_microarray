## Abstract
Current understanding of mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion-induced lung injury during
lung preservation and transplantation is mainly based on clinical observations and animal studies.
Herein, we used cell and systems biology approaches to explore these mechanisms at transcriptomics
levels, especially by focusing on the differences between human lung endothelial and epithelial
cells, which are crucial for maintaining essential lung structure and function. Human pulmonary
microvascular endothelial cells and human lung epithelial cells were cultured to confluent, subjected
to different cold ischemic times (CIT) to mimic static cold storage with preservation solution, and
then subjected to warm reperfusion with a serum containing culture medium to simulate lung
transplantation. Cell morphology, viability, and transcriptomic profiles were studied. Ischemiareperfusion injury induced a CIT time-dependent cell death, which was associated with dramatic
changes in gene expression. Under normal control conditions, endothelial cells showed gene clusters
enriched in the vascular process and inflammation, while epithelial cells showed gene clusters
enriched in protein biosynthesis and metabolism. CIT 6 h alone or after reperfusion had little
effect on these phenotypic characteristics. After CIT 18 h, protein-biosynthesis-related gene clusters
disappeared in epithelial cells; after reperfusion, metabolism-related gene clusters in epithelial cells
and multiple gene clusters in the endothelial cells also disappeared. Human pulmonary endothelial
and epithelial cells have distinct phenotypic transcriptomic signatures. Severe cellular injury reduces
these gene expression signatures in a cell-type-dependent manner. Therapeutics that preserve
these transcriptomic signatures may represent new treatment to prevent acute lung injury during
lung transplantation.
